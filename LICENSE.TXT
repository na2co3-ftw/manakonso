DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.
The software contains code that you are permitted to distribute in
applications you develop as described in this Section.
(For this Section the term “distribution” also means deployment of
your applications for third parties to access over the Internet.)

 Right to Use and Distribute.
 The code and text files listed below are “Distributable Code.”

 · REDIST.TXT Files. You may copy and distribute the object code form of
   code listed in the redist.txt file in the software and on the REDIST list
   located at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523763&clcid=0x409 .
 · Sample Code, Templates and Styles. You may copy, modify and distribute
   the source and object code form of code marked as “sample”, “template”,

   the Image Library(ies) as described in the software documentation.
 · Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your applications
   to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those applications.

 Distribution Requirements.
 For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must:

 · add significant primary functionality to it in your applications;
 · require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect
   it at least as much as this agreement;
 · indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
   including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of
   your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely
   on the Distributable Code.

 Distribution Restrictions.
 You may not:

 · use Microsoft’s trademarks in your applications’ names or in a way that
   suggests your applications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
 · modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any
   part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License
   is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution,
   that (i) the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form;
   or (ii) others have the right to modify it.
